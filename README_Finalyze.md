- 📊 Live Data Dashboard for daily/weekly/monthly trends
- 🏦 Support for 15+ Indian Banks (SBI, HDFC, Axis, ICICI...)
- 🔄 CSV to Insights Pipeline (no DB setup required)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS + Recharts  
- **Backend:** Python Flask API with CORS enabled  
- **ML Engine:** Numpy + Pandas — includes a custom-built manual neural network for predicting future transactions and generating financial insights  
- **AI Analysis:** Implements AI-driven analytics using manually programmed neural logic (without external ML libraries) for forecasting and anomaly detection  
- **PDF Generator:** ReportLab (Unicode ₹ support)  
- **Data Handling:** CSV-based (scalable to SQL later)
